# üè∫ alAssets

alAssets represent users' future yield from deposited yield-bearing collateral, functioning as tokenized loans for the different strategies (e.g., ETH for alETH, various stablecoins for alUSD).

alAssets can be swapped for other assets, paired with other assets to provide liquidity, converted to their underlying assets via the Transmuter, or used in various DeFi protocols such as the ones on [Alchemix Stats](https://alchemix-stats.com/earn).

Because alAssets represent _future_ yield, they are typically expected to be valued by the market at a discount from 1:1 with their associated underlying asset. Thus, experienced DeFi users may wish to purchase alAssets directly (instead of taking a loan) to earn yield, speculate on the price of the alAsset, or profit by converting it back to its underlying asset via the Transmuter. This type of user is the counterparty that makes it possible to access self-repaying loans from Alchemix.&#x20;

Governance mechanisms and systems, such as the Transmuter, Elixir AMO, and liquidity incentives provided by the DAO treasury, work together to influence the price and manage the supply of alAssets.

## Key Features

### **Yield Representation**

alAssets represent future yield generated by deposited assets in the platform.



### **Discounted Trading**

alAssets typically trade at a discount to the underlying, reflecting their representation of future value.



### **Governance Oversight**

The alAsset supply and price are influenced by the Transmuter, Elixir AMO, and DAO-managed liquidity incentives (find more info about the incentives in [staking-pool-incentives.md](../alchemix-dao/the-alchemix-dao/staking-pool-incentives.md "mention")).



### **Debt Repayment**

Enables users to repay debt or convert assets using alAssets.



### **Collateral Deposit Cap**

Ensures a predictable maximum global supply in addition to Alchemist collateral deposit caps.

## How it works

1. **Deposit Collateral:** Users deposit collateral assets into the Alchemix protocol.
2. **alAsset Issuance:** When users take out loans, they receive alAssets representing their future yield from the deposited assets.
3. **Market Accessibility:** Users can utilize alAssets for various on-chain transactions, including market swaps and loan repayments.
4. **Liquidity Management:** Users taking loans will expand the supply of alAssets. Loan repayments, Transmutation, and the Elixir AMO will all shrink the supply of alAssets. The price of the alAsset is representative of these mechanisms, as well as demand for loans, third-party liquidity providers, and Transmuter users.&#x20;
5. **Transmuter Conversion:** Users can deposit alAssets into the Transmuter, gradually converting them into their underlying collateral assets over time.
