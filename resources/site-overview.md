## Site overview

Fellow Alchemists, welcome to the Alchemix v2 user interface.

This guide will help you familiarize yourself with the platform.

First and foremost, the v2 website is a place where you‚Äôll be able to set up and manage your Alchemix loans, farm with your tokens, use the Transmuter and vote on governance proposals. The first time you arrive at the site, you‚Äôll see the introduction page that tells you about the product and shows you what base assets are supported, along with their current loan to values. This list will grow continuously as new assets are added. If you ever want to return here, just click on the Alchemix logo at the top left of the page or the Intro button in the footer.

First you‚Äôll need to connect your wallet. Click the ‚ÄòConnect wallet‚Äô button and follow the prompts to select your wallet provider.

**Connect wallet button**

Once you‚Äôve connected to your chosen wallet, you‚Äôll be taken to the Vaults page that‚Äôs associated with your connected address.

alAssets are a fundamental concept to understand when using Alchemix. Whenever you take a loan against your deposit, it will always be issued in the form of an alAsset. For example, alUSD is the asset you‚Äôd borrow against all stablecoin assets that you‚Äôve deposited as collateral. The stablecoin collateral you‚Äôve deposited could be composed of a variety of stablecoins. For example, you may have deposited a mixture of DAI, USDC and Tether. Since these are all dollar-pegged assets you‚Äôll only need to borrow one asset, alUSD.

Let‚Äôs take a look at the vaults page.

Whether you have an existing loan or not, the vaults page will display the current available strategies. You can take advantage of any of these, as they cover the full range of assets that we currently support. This list will grow longer over time. To help manage what‚Äôs visible, you can use the toggles to filter for the alAssets that you‚Äôre most interested in.

Each vault listed will show the collateral assets you can deposit and the current APY.

Moving on, let‚Äôs check out the Transmuter page. This is where you can swap your alAssets at a guaranteed 1:1 ratio for equal value tokens. Unlike the open market where pegged assets can fluctuate in value by small amounts, the Transmuter ensures you won‚Äôt suffer any loss or slippage. The drawback, however, is that it takes time to swap your assets. So, if you need to exchange immediately, we recommend you use other exchanges. We‚Äôve linked a few external swap providers at the top of the page.

Next, let's look at the Farms page. Here you can stake LP tokens and single sided ALCX to earn rewards. You can also wrap your ALCX into gALCX which automagically stakes your ALCX into the single sided pool and auto-compounding rewards. gALCX can also be used cross chain and on layer 2 networks as we roll out our multi-chain strategy.

Moving on to Governance. Here you can see a list of all the previous and active Alchemix improvement proposals or AIPs. Holders of ALCX are eligible to vote on any active proposal.

One last thing to draw your attention to. The website will store some user preferences on your computer‚Äôs local storage, should you wish to set your preferred display currency, gas defaults and language. You can set them either at the top of any page or navigate to the settings page.
