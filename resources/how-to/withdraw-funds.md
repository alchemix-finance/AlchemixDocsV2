# üçÄ Withdraw funds

When you want to move your funds back into your wallet you‚Äôll need to call the ‚Äòwithdraw‚Äô function.

Something to bear in mind is that you can only withdraw funds that exceed the collateral requirements of any outstanding loans you have.

If for example you‚Äôve borrowed 50% of your deposit of a loan that has a 50% loan-to-value ratio then you won‚Äôt be able to withdraw any funds unless you either repay your debt or liquidate it with your deposit.

In the previous guide, we liquidated our loan which releases the funds to be withdrawn.

Click the + button next to the vault you want to withdraw from and click the 'Withdraw' tab. You‚Äôll notice you have the choice to receive the standard or yield bearing asset, in this case wETH or yvwETH.

Since we want ETH in our wallet following the withdrawal, we‚Äôll toggle the wETH/ETH switch. The system will conveniently withdraw wETH and convert it to ETH for us.

In this case we‚Äôll choose ‚Äòmax‚Äô since we want to completely exit the vault.

Like the liquidate and deposit functions, withdraw adds slippage protection control to allow users to limit the slippage as the system converts assets to unwind your position.

Click ‚ÄòWithdraw‚Äô and confirm the transactions in your wallet.

When you‚Äôve successfully withdrawn you‚Äôll see your updated balance reflected in your wallet.
