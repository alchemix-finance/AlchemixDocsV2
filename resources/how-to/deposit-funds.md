# ⚡ Deposit funds

The unique thing about Alchemix loans is that they allow you to leverage your wealth without any risk of liquidation. Another way to put this is that Alchemix lets you borrow against an asset without carrying the risk of losing your collateral in the event of a market crash.

To setup a new loan, first visit the Vaults page on the website. Here is a list of available vaults where users can deposit any of the supported collateral assets.

Each vault displays the tokens used as collateral. Users are able to deposit these tokens to take a loan.

Let’s see how you can borrow against some of your ETH holdings with a new alETH loan.

First, click on the + button on the Yearn wETH vault. This will open the deposit section which offers you several deposit options.

Let’s go from the top. The LTV tells you how much you can borrow against your deposit. 50% means you’ll be able to borrow a maximum of half the deposited amount.

In this example, the vault accepts wETH or yvwETH. Luckily there is a handy conversion tool built into the wETH vault that allows you to convert your ETH to wETH during the deposit.

All you need to do is click the toggle and the input box allows you to input the ETH amount you’d like to deposit.

Let’s input a value of 1 ETH.

Next, we have slippage. For certain vaults, such as the Yearn vaults, when you deposit collateral, Alchemix converts it into the Yearn equivalent. This process allows Alchemix to earn yield on your deposit. For example, it will exchange wETH for yvWETH on your behalf. Because exchange rates fluctuate, your vault will receive a slightly different amount of yvwETH in return. This is usually minimal and not something you need to worry about. To protect our users, they are able to set your own slippage limits.

Now, you can press ‘deposit’ and authorize the transaction in your wallet. If it’s your first time depositing into one of our vaults, two transactions will need to be confirmed. The first is the token approval and the second will be the actual deposit.

Once your transaction has completed you’ll be able to see how much you’ve deposited in the vault.
