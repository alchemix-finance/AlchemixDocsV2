# ðŸŒ± Staking Pool Incentives

{% hint style="info" %}
Take a look at the current Staking & Incentives program[ here](https://alchemix-stats.com/earn).
{% endhint %}

Alchemix alAssets require deep liquidity to be maximally effective.

The Staking Pools' primary purpose is to distribute ALCX tokens to community members who provide liquidity to the Alchemix ecosystem.

The emissions distribution is modified through governance proposals. Below are the types of pools, how they are incentivized, and their reasoning for existing:

1. alUSD and alETH LP tokens: Users may provide alAsset liquidity pools on 3rd-party decentralized exchanges, and stake their liquidity with these exchanges. These third-party pools aim to establish prices closer to 1:1 than the market would naturally allow, ensuring deep liquidity for alUSD and alETH. This enhances Alchemix's value proposition and boosts liquidity provider confidence. Incentives include protocol liquidity assets (vlCVX, sdCRV, veRAM, veVELO), ALCX emissions, and vote incentivization platforms.
2. ALCX/ETH LP tokens: Users may provide ALCX/ETH liquidity on Balancer, with the option to stake for additional yield on Balancer and Aura Finance, among other platforms.
3. ALCX single token staking: This Alchemix-owned pool rewards ALCX holders who may be too risk-averse to participate in the ALCX/ETH pool. It also acts as an anti-dilutive measure for ALCX holders. The community will determine the longevity of this pool.

These pools and their weights will be adjusted as Alchemix introduces additional alchemical synthetic tokens to the market. The priority will be to incentivize synthetic pairs with their base asset.
