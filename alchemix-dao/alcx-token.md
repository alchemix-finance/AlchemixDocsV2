# âœ¨ ALCX Token

## **ALCX Token Overview**

The ALCX token is an ERC-20 token that serves as both the governance and incentive token for the Alchemix platform.

The token was launched without presales or external funding. ALCX does not have a hard cap, but does have a carefully crafted emissions schedule (token mints). Emissions are the rate at which new ALCX tokens are minted. The token emissions are distributed to liquidity providers, the treasury, and also to contributors to the protocol.&#x20;

The ALCX emissions (slow minting) gradually reduce issuance over three years, continuing with a long tail of fixed weekly emissions. Alchemix is now in the long-tail period, where 2200 ALCX are minted per week indefinitely.

### **The ALCX Token Distribution & Emissions were distributed as:**

* 15% pre-mine for the Alchemix DAO
* 5% for Bug Bounties
* 80% of tokens available through LP staking
  * Founders, developers, and community contributors can access an exclusive staking pool that will receive 20% of the current ALCX emissions. This equates to 16% of the supply after 3 years.
  * Stakers and liquidity providers are eligible to obtain 80% of the ALCX block reward, which will equate to 64% of the supply after 3 years. Currently, a portion of these emissions are sent to the treasury.

This token distribution allocates the majority of tokens to those who contribute to the Alchemix protocol through working or liquidity provision. It assures that no one from the development team will have enough tokens to control the protocol while rewarding them for their work and incentivizing them to continue working on it.

An initial supply of 478,612 $ALCX was minted as a pre-mine. Alchemix calculated that there would be 2,393,060 $ALCX in circulation after 3 years in the following distribution:

* 15% (358,959 tokens) to the DAO treasury
* 5% (119,653 tokens) to the bug bounty program

The staking pools distributed approximately 22,344 $ALCX tokens in their first week, with a 130 $ALCX weekly decrease for the first 3 years. Calculations are approximate as $ALCX rewards are calculated per block, and network conditions, although negligible, may slightly affect the schedule.

Alchemix is over three years old, which means a fixed 2200 $ALCX is emitted weekly, increasing the total supply by 114,400 $ALCX annually. This will lead to a gradual decrease in inflation over time.

At the three-year point, there was approximately a 4.5% annual inflation of supply, which has gradually decreased over time.
