# üè∞ The Alchemix DAO

## Empowering Community Governance

The Alchemix DAO serves as the governance backbone for the Alchemix ecosystem. Its primary objectives include:

1. **Treasury Management:** The DAO receives protocol income from fees and allocates funds for development, maintenance, audits, and community initiatives.
2. **Ecosystem Project Funding:** The DAO supports projects that enhance Alchemix or utilize Alchemix components.
3. **Bug Bounty:** A significant portion of ALCX tokens is reserved for bug bounties, ensuring protocol security. Vulnerabilities can be reported via the [Alchemix website](https://app.alchemix.fi/) or the [Immunefi Bug Bounty](https://bugs.immunefi.com/program-reports) program.&#x20;
4. **Supporting Ethereum Community:** The DAO occasionally allocates treasury income to initiatives like Gitcoin grants and charitable programs, fostering broader community support.
5. **Governance Voting:** ALCX token holders influence protocol direction and treasury usage through governance voting, ensuring community representation.

## The Future

As the Alchemix protocol and DAO advances there will be a progressive shift to empower community governance through a transparent and open process. The team values community feedback and recognizes the wealth of knowledge and diversity of skillset within the community and anticipates that this will significantly shape the DAO's direction and design.

## **Bug Bounty Program**

Alchemix offers a bug bounty program to maintain protocol security. The program encourages users to report vulnerabilities for bug bounty rewards. Vulnerabilities can be reported via the [Alchemix website](https://app.alchemix.fi/) or the [Immunefi Bug Bounty](https://bugs.immunefi.com/program-reports) program.



## **DAO Grants Program**

The Alchemix Grants program, launched to fund various Alchemix-related projects, is hosted through Questbook: [alchemix.questbook.app](https://t.co/SUDI85lFzB).
